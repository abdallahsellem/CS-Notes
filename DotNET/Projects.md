# **"Event Management System with Advanced Features"**

#### **Project Overview:**

A web-based **Event Management System** where users can organize and manage events (such as conferences, workshops, or seminars), register for events, and handle event-related tasks. This project will involve API development, background services, security, and a few advanced ASP.NET Core features, but without going into a full microservices architecture. The goal is to challenge you but stay within the 3-week timeline.

#### **Key Features:**

1. **User Authentication & Role Management**:
    
    - Implement **ASP.NET Core Identity** for user authentication with roles like Admin, Event Organizer, and Attendee.
    - Use **JWT Tokens** for securing API endpoints.
    - Include role-based access control, e.g., Admins can manage all events, while Organizers can only manage their own events.
2. **Event CRUD Operations**:
    
    - Implement event creation, updating, deleting, and viewing using both **API Controllers** and **MVC Views**.
    - Support **multiple categories** for events (e.g., technology, health, education).
3. **Event Registration System**:
    
    - Attendees can register for events.
    - Include logic to track available seats and prevent overbooking.
    - Admins and Event Organizers can manage and view attendee lists.
4. **Search and Filtering**:
    
    - Add **filtering** and **search** functionality for events based on keywords, categories, and dates.
    - Use **attribute-based routing** to create RESTful APIs for searching events.
5. **Background Services for Notifications**:
    
    - Set up **background services** to send notifications (via email or in-app) to attendees when they register or when an event is updated.
    - Use **IHostedService** or **Hangfire** for scheduling tasks.
6. **Error Handling and Logging**:
    
    - Implement **global error handling** using custom middleware.
    - Use **Serilog** for structured logging, capturing logs for event creation, registration, and errors.
    - Log critical actions such as user registrations and event updates.
7. **Lazy vs Eager vs Explicit Loading**:
    
    - Use **Lazy Loading** to load related data (like event details and attendee lists) only when necessary.
    - Apply **Eager Loading** for common scenarios where related data is always required (e.g., when viewing an event with its organizer's details).
    - Utilize **Explicit Loading** for more controlled data loading in performance-sensitive cases.
8. **Dashboard for Admins and Event Organizers**:
    
    - Create a basic dashboard for event organizers and admins to monitor ongoing events, registrations, and user statistics.
    - Include simple charts or tables to display data (e.g., number of events per category or total registrations).
9. **Asynchronous Data Operations**:
    
    - Make use of **async/await** throughout the application, especially for database operations (CRUD) to improve scalability.
    - Ensure that all event creation, registration, and notifications are handled asynchronously.
10. **Security and Data Validation**:
    
    - Add **data validation** and form validation on the client side using **Data Annotations**.
    - Implement **Authorization Policies** to protect different actions, ensuring that only authorized roles can access certain features (e.g., only Admin can delete events).
11. **Deployment**:
    
    - Deploy the application using **Docker** (build Docker images for your application) and optionally deploy on a platform like **Azure App Service** or **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
    - Set up **CI/CD pipelines** (optional) using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps.

#### **Technology Stack**:

- **Frontend**: Razor Pages or a minimal React/Angular UI.
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core (Web API + MVC).
- **Database**: SQL Server (with Entity Framework Core for ORM).
- **Other Tools**: Serilog for logging, Docker for containerization, SendGrid (or SMTP) for email notifications.

### **Project Breakdown for 3 Weeks**:

- **Week 1**:
    
    - Set up project structure.
    - Implement **user authentication and role management** using Identity.
    - Create **CRUD operations** for events.
    - Set up the **database** with migrations using EF Core.
    - Implement **JWT Authentication** for securing APIs.
- **Week 2**:
    
    - Build the **event registration system** (including validation and notifications).
    - Implement the **search and filter functionality** for events.
    - Set up **background services** to handle email notifications for registrations.
    - Add **global error handling** and **logging** using Serilog.
- **Week 3**:
    
    - Create a basic **admin/organizer dashboard** to view statistics.
    - Optimize database queries with **lazy, eager, and explicit loading** strategies.
    - Work on **UI enhancements** (if using Razor Pages or a frontend framework).
    - Package the app with **Docker** and deploy it (optional CI/CD).

### **Learning Outcomes**:

- Master **Identity and Role-based Authentication** in ASP.NET Core.
- Implement both **API Controllers** and **MVC Views** in a real-world application.
- Understand and use **background services** for long-running tasks like notifications.
- Learn how to handle **lazy/eager/explicit loading** in Entity Framework Core.
- Practice **logging** and **error handling** to maintain a reliable system.
- Deploy a **containerized** ASP.NET Core application.
