## **"AI-Powered Job Recruitment System"**

### **Project Overview:**

A web-based **Job Recruitment System** where employers can **post job openings**, and candidates can **apply for jobs**, while an AI-powered recommendation system suggests the best candidates for a job. This project involves **API development, authentication, background services, AI integration, and security**, staying within a **3-week development** timeframe.

---

### **Key Features:**

#### **1. User Authentication & Role Management**

- Use **ASP.NET Core Identity** for authentication with roles like **Admin, Employer, and Job Seeker**.
- Implement **JWT-based authentication** for securing APIs.
	- Role-based access control:
	    - **Employers** can post/manage jobs.
	    - **Job Seekers** can apply for jobs.
	    - **Admins** can monitor system activity.

#### **2. Job Posting & Management**

- Employers can **create, edit, delete, and list jobs**.
- Jobs include **position title, description, salary range, required skills, and location**.
- Status updates (e.g., Open, Closed, Hiring Completed).

#### **3. Job Application System**

- Job seekers can **apply** to available jobs.
- Prevent duplicate applications for the same job.
- Track **application status** (e.g., Pending, Interview Scheduled, Rejected, Accepted).
- Employers can review applicants and update statuses.

#### **4. Smart Search & Filtering**

- Search jobs by **title, location, experience level, salary, and skills**.
- Implement **full-text search** and **filtering** using LINQ queries.

#### **5. AI-Powered Candidate Matching (Optional but Creative)**

- Use **ML.NET or OpenAI API** to recommend the best candidates for a job.
- Analyze **resume content, skills, and past experiences** to score applicants.
- Display **AI-recommended candidates** to employers.

#### **6. Background Services for Notifications**

- **Automated email notifications** (e.g., when a candidate applies, when an employer reviews applications).
- Use **IHostedService or Hangfire** for scheduled reminders (e.g., “Your job posting is expiring soon!”).

#### **7. Logging & Error Handling**

- Implement **global exception handling** using middleware.
- Use **Serilog** for structured logging (e.g., job postings, user registrations, failed applications).
- Track **system performance logs**.

#### **8. Lazy vs Eager vs Explicit Loading**

- **Lazy Loading:** Load job applications only when an employer views them.
- **Eager Loading:** Always fetch job details along with employer info.
- **Explicit Loading:** Load candidate profiles only when required.

#### **9. Employer & Admin Dashboards**

- Employers see job stats, candidate applications, and AI recommendations.
- Admins can **manage users, monitor activity logs, and oversee applications**.
- Use **simple charts (e.g., job postings per category, application trends).**

#### **10. Asynchronous Data Operations**

- **Use async/await** for job listing, applying, and notifications.
- **Optimize database queries** for high scalability.

#### **11. Security & Data Validation**

- Use **Data Annotations** for job posting & application validation.
- **Authorization Policies** for securing actions (e.g., **only Employers can review applications**).

#### **12. Deployment**

- **Containerize the app with Docker**.
- Deploy on **Azure App Service / AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
- Optional: **CI/CD using GitHub Actions**.

### **Database Schema**

We'll define key **tables/entities**:

#### **Users Table (Employers, Job Seekers, Admins)**

- `Id (PK)`
- `FullName`
- `Email`
- `PasswordHash`
- `Role (Admin, Employer, JobSeeker)`
- `CreatedAt`

#### **Jobs Table**

- `Id (PK)`
- `Title`
- `Description`
- `Category (IT, Healthcare, etc.)`
- `Location`
- `SalaryRange`
- `RequiredSkills (JSON array)`
- `EmployerId (FK → Users.Id)`
- `Status (Open, Closed)`
- `CreatedAt`

#### **Applications Table**

- `Id (PK)`
- `JobId (FK → Jobs.Id)`
- `JobSeekerId (FK → Users.Id)`
- `ResumeURL`
- `Status (Pending, Interview, Rejected, Hired)`
- `AppliedAt`

#### **AI Recommendations Table (Optional)**

- `Id (PK)`
- `JobId (FK → Jobs.Id)`
- `RecommendedUserId (FK → Users.Id)`
- `Score (AI Matching Score)`
- `CreatedAt`
```
In the `RecommendedApplicant` class, the `Job` and `RecommendedUser` properties are marked as `virtual` because they are **navigation properties** in Entity Framework (EF). Here's why this is done:

### 1. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Marking a navigation property as `virtual` enables **lazy loading** in Entity Framework. Lazy loading means that the related data (e.g., `Job` or `RecommendedUser`) is not loaded from the database until it is accessed for the first time.
   - For example, if you access `RecommendedApplicant.Job`, EF will automatically query the database to fetch the related `Job` entity.

### 2. **Proxy Creation**:
   - When a navigation property is `virtual`, EF can create a **proxy class** at runtime that overrides the property. This proxy class is responsible for implementing lazy loading.
   - Without the `virtual` keyword, EF cannot override the property, and lazy loading will not work.

### 3. **Navigation Properties**:
   - Navigation properties represent relationships between entities. In this case:
     - `Job` is a navigation property that links the `RecommendedApplicant` to a `Job` entity.
     - `RecommendedUser` is a navigation property that links the `RecommendedApplicant` to a `User` entity.
   - Marking them as `virtual` ensures that EF can manage these relationships efficiently.

### 4. **Optional Behavior**:
   - If you do not want lazy loading or proxy creation, you can remove the `virtual` keyword. In that case, you would need to use **eager loading** (e.g., `.Include()`) or **explicit loading** to load related data.

### Example of Lazy Loading:
```csharp
var applicant = context.RecommendedApplicants.FirstOrDefault();
var job = applicant.Job; // This triggers a database query to load the Job entity
```

### Example of Eager Loading (if `virtual` is removed):
```csharp
var applicant = context.RecommendedApplicants
    .Include(a => a.Job)
    .FirstOrDefault();
```

### Summary:
The `virtual` keyword is used to enable lazy loading and allow EF to manage relationships dynamically. If you prefer to control when related data is loaded (e.g., using eager or explicit loading), you can remove the `virtual` keyword. However, leaving it as `virtual` provides flexibility and simplifies relationship management in many scenarios.
