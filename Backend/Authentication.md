## Token based vs JWT
### Key Differences:

|Feature|Token-Based Authentication|JWT Authentication|
|---|---|---|
|**Token Type**|Can be any string (e.g., session ID, opaque token)|A structured, self-contained token (JSON format)|
|**Token Storage**|Server-side and client-side|Typically stateless (only client-side)|
|**State Management**|Stateful (server tracks tokens)|Stateless (server doesnâ€™t store JWT)|
|**Structure**|Arbitrary (no specific structure)|JSON format with header, payload, and signature|
|**Validation**|Server checks token validity (stored in DB/session)|Signature validation on the server|
|**Data Contained in Token**|Minimal or none (token ID only)|User claims and metadata can be embedded|
|**Token Revocation**|Can be revoked by server at any time|More complex, typically requires token expiration|
|**Use Case**|Traditional session management|Modern distributed systems, microservices|

### Conclusion:

JWT is a specific type of token used in token-based authentication systems. It is particularly useful in stateless, distributed systems where you want to avoid the need for server-side session storage. Traditional token-based systems are more stateful, requiring server-side storage and management of the tokens.
